# Scout Coaching Booking Platform

Scout is a booking platform that allows coaches to open slots on their calendar, provide feedback, and view upcoming bookings with their students.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** PostgreSQL, Next.js (API layer), Prisma
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Zustand, ShadCN components
- **Time Management:** Date-fns and date-fns-tz for handling dates and times in the 'America/New_York' timezone

## Database

The platform uses a PostgreSQL database with the following core entities:

- **User:** Represents both coaches and students.
- **Slot:** Represents a time block a coach makes available for booking.
- **Booking:** Represents a student's reservation of a specific slot.
- **Feedback:** Represents feedback provided by a student after a booking.

### Core Relationships

- **User-CoachSlots-Slot:** A coach can have many slots (one-to-many).
- **Slot-SlotBooking-Booking:** A slot can have one booking (one-to-one).
- **User-Booking:** A student can have many bookings (one-to-many).
- **Booking-Feedback:** A booking can have one feedback (one-to-one).
